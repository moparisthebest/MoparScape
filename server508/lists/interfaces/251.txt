Child: 5, message: Use this ring when you are ready to summon me to your aid. It is a daunting task, yet you must battle the king to allow me to remove the spell from him. When the king is almost dead, use this ring and I will teleport to your aid. Be warned - Though I am skilled with magic, I am no fighter! Should you summon me too early I will have to teleport us out of danger! When our mission is completed, I will remove the summon ability from this ring, but you may keep it for protection.                                   Zaff
